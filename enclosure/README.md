# Mega IIe STL Files
These are the STLs to re-print the Mega IIe enclosure.

This design is based on this [Apple IIe Model](https://grabcad.com/library/apple-iie-personal-computer-1) by Tommy Mueller on GrabCAD. That model only had faces, so it wasn't as simple as "download and print." And I had to make a few changes to accomodate putting real hardware inside.

## STLs
The final STL versions of each component. The names should be self-explanatory. 

Notes
* Glue (or tape) the Power LED to the back of the keyboard
* Glue the keyboard to the top case.
* Glue RESET key into place.
* Insert the floor panel (with PCB) before putting in the keyboard
* Insert a Speaker (I used one from a IIc) and then glue that piece to the back of the keyboard.

* There is a mix of 2, 3, and 3.5 mm heat inserts. 
* `Stand off for lid` offsets the case from the table for painting.


## Printing Notes
I printed on a Prusa MK3. I did all of the printing before PrusaSlicer supported organic supports.

* Main body needs tons of (traditional) supports. Takes >24 hours to print.
* Lid seemed to do best on its thin side. Otherwise, supports are a pain to clean off.
* Lid may also need to be scaled based on how much paint you add.


## Fusion 360
All of the CAD work was done in Autodesk's [Fusion 360 for personal](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal).
