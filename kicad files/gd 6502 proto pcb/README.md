## gd 6502 proto pcb
6502 board is designed for a WDC W65c02 with a QFP footprint. It has a single socket for an EPROM and is wired like the IIc's EEPROM. The `Address` and `Data` headers are meant to connect to the MEGA-II proto board. Other control signals are broken out to other headers.

Runs off of 5V.
