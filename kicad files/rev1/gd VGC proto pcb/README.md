## gd VGC proto pcb
VGC = Video Graphics Controller

First board to be finished and the one with the least use for the final handheld. The VGC converts the RGB bitstream from the MEGA-II into an analog signal and then into NTSC.

The VGC also generates the 14 MHz clock from a 28 MHz oscilliator. (It is not clear yet which clocks the MEGA-II generates and which the VGC does.)

Runs off of +5V, -5V, and +12V. The 12V and -5V are used by the NTSC generation circuit.

## Rev1 Notes:
* Nothing... yet :)
